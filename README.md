# CS2820 Spring 2023 WARP Project Code
This code base will be used for the University of Iowa CS 2820 Introduction to Software
Development course. The code was developed by Steve Goddard for the WARP sensor network 
research project. It was first written in Swift and rewritten in Java. It was then 
rewritten again in an object-oriented programming style. It was a quick
hack, and it needs a lot of cleanup and refactoring. A perfect code base to teach
the value of software developement fundamentals!

Implemented a main() function to <b> WorkLoadDescription.java </b>. The user inputs a graph text file,
and the function outputs the file with the flows alphabetically ordered and numbered in ascending order.
